This project was created using Flask for writing a REST API, PostgreSQL for the database and pgAdmin as the database administration tool.
The API is exposed on port 5000. The database stores data in ./db/data, and the init script for the database is in ./db/init/create-table.sql.
For logging in to the pgAdmin platform, you must use the login data found in the docker-compose.yml file.
